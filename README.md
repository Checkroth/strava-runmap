Hooks in to Strava API to create a page of all of your historical runs in strava.

## Requirements

This plugin requires the pacakges in `requiremnets.txt` to be installed in the pelican implementation that is using this plugin.

## Installation

This plugin can (not yet) be installed via:

python -m pip install pelican-strava_runmap
As long as you have not explicitly added a `PLUGINS` setting to your Pelican settings file, then the newly-installed plugin should be automatically detected and enabled. Otherwise, you must add `strava_runmap` to your existing `PLUGINS` list. For more information, please see the [How to Use Plugins](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins) documentation.

## Usage

### Configuration

Environment variables / pelican configs: The following are environment variables names. They have the _same key as the environment variable name_ in `STRAVA_RUNMAP_CONFIG` in the pelican config (e.g. `STRAVA_RUNMAP_CONFIG = { "STRAVA_API_TOKEN": "abcd1234" }`
- `STRAVA_API_TOKEN`: a valid token is required to get activitiesto generate the runmap page.
- `STRAVA_ENDPOINT`: Defaults to `https://www.strava.com`, but is configurable. If you configure it, it must be:
  - A valid url scheme (start with http(s)://)
  - Not end in a slash (the plugin adds the trailing `/`)
- `STRAVA_DRY_RUN`: Evaluates to bool. Omit if it's not a dry run, fill it with anything if it is a dry run. Dry run fills with a few test images, but does not actually hit the strava API (use this if you haven't got a token yet or are repeatedly re-generating and want to speed things up and avoid getting rate-limited.)

### Setting up strava

Requires `STRAVA_API_TOKEN` environment variable when building your site. You can get this token by following the [Strava Guide].

Because this plugin does not keep track of your actual strava details (including access and refresh tokens), once the token you generate with Strava expires you will have to generate a new one via their web interface (or whatever method you prefer). If you know if a better way to do this, please feel free to submit a pull request :)

Some tips:

- You can get your key from the [strava application page] once you have set it up.
- The token is rate limited. Unless you have a HUGE amount of activities or are constantly rebuilding, you shouldn't hit it.
  - If you are doing a trial/error and want to avoid using your quota, set your config or environment variable `STRAVA_DRY_RUN=1` . This will generate a few dummy maps for layout testing and preview, without using up your quota.

### Using the Insomnia Collecion

Included in this repository is `strava_insomnia_collection` which includes some helpful requests that can be used for setup and debugging.

Just import the file in insomnia and add the following environment variables:
- `strava_domain`: Should just be `www.strava.com` unless you're doing something very special.
- `strava_api_domain`: Should be `www.strava.com/api/v3` unless you're doing something very special.
- `client_id`: from your Strava API Application
- `client_secret`: from your Strava API Application
- `refresh_token`: from your Strava API Application
- `code`: see below
- `api_token`: see below

Then, copy the URL from the `Authorization Code` request and open it in a browser (it will not work embedded in Insomnia). Click "Authorize" and you will be taken to a page error (because you probably don't have any local web server serving something -- that's fine). The URL serving this error will contain a `code` query parameter. Save that to the `code` environment variable.

Now you can hit the `Get Token` endpoint. Save the value from `access_token` in the response body to the `api_token` environment variable.

You should now be set up to use the strava API -- you can test it out by hitting some of the prepared endpoints.
